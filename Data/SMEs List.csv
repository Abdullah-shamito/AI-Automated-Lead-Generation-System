The story started with us, two friends, who after having run extensive online research to establish the needs of the digital market, noticed that content was already a common notion and a highly-exercised service, but was rather much generalized and often verbatim. It needed to be more reflective of the culture of the target market, more accurately and better styled to deliver the right message to the right market. I

This left us vast room for improvement in the sector. It was the ideal opportunity for us to finally leave our footprints on the world of content marketing.

So, we decided to set up a small company with one aim in mind: to create better content than what was offered out there, comprehensive and tailored to the different needs and demands of each individual client and field.",2009,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/66bd923503a0a30001291ec5/picture,,,,

Our vision is to build the smartest carpooling solution for urban commuters. As you might suspect we connect drivers with empty seats to passengers looking for a ride. Carpool Arabia is a regular idea made sustainable by reducing the number of cars on the road, thus making the world a better place to live.

We help people to find a commuting buddy to ease their daily transportation to the office. With Carpool Arabia mobile app you can easily find a driver that can pick you up at home and drop you at work. Our machine-learning app always finds the best pool of drivers called ""buddies"" to give you a ride. As a driver, you can accept or decline the ride anonymously from your carpooling buddy. Drivers receive ride request only if the detour is less than 15 minutes. Carpool Arabia creates local daily heroes and helps them to find the perfect commuting buddy.

Carpooling has many advantages for corporations/organizations:
•	Reduces overall transportation budgets, allowances and parking fees.
•	By respecting the environment with this ""green initiative,"" companies reinforce their favorable public image.
•	It encourages and improves social relationships among employees.

Carpooling also has many benefits for their employees:

❌ They've had close calls in past projects where their estimation and procurement systems only just held it together
❌ They're starting to win more substantial projects and know that their systems will reach a breaking point.

Because excel spreadsheets (whizzed from one person to another via email) or estimation & ERP software (that only works with spreadsheets) all have the same problem.

The only glue that holds them together is people
➡️Did they capture the quotes correctly?
➡️Did they remember to update it in the system?
➡️Did they send it to the right people?
We help you go from manually-coordinated estimation and procurement to a system that unifies your teams with technology.

✅ One place for everyone to collaborate 
✅ Accurate cost & buying decisions
✅ Free up your team to focus on what matters 
✅ Usable from day 1

The restaurant is set to become one of Dubai's favourite eateries featuring uncomplicated, delicious yet refreshingly affordable food based on quality ingredients and served with passion in a relaxed, fun and vibrant environment. Fumé celebrates traditional preparation methods that recollect flavourful childhood memories of comforting, home-style cooking inspired by the great cuisines of the world.

To wash it all down Fumé's mixologists have created a charming selection of rustic yet contemporary beverages that sit contentedly alongside the great classics, hops, grapes and bubbles of the world. Rumour has it that there will even be a cheeky selection of adult milkshakes, brimming with flavour and faux-innocence.

Vintage is the new Cool! Hence, the restaurant interiors feature quirky period industrial elements that evoke a certain ‘je ne sais quoi'. Reminiscent of a bygone era yet enticingly familiar, Fumé will charm its patrons with a spirited experience in cosy, comfortable surroundings.

We launched our revolutionary private Jet club in 2007 with a mission to reinvent the private aviation industry.  To a large degree, we already have, as evidenced by multiple top honors from organizations such as Robb Report and Aviation International News.

We are unapologetically optimistic. We believe anything is possible. Call us naïve. Or patently positive. But for us, ""no"" is never an option.  We believe in the absolute power of people operating at their highest individual level and are laser-focused on outrageously attentive service on the global stage. We do not merely meet needs; we anticipate them. Whether on the ramp, in the lounge or the executive office, XJetters demand the most of themselves and their colleagues. 

This is our Seven-Star Service. 

Headquartered in the United Arab Emirates, XJet provides its unique brand of Seven Star Service from its flagship facility London's Stansted Airport in the United Kingdom. 

We launched our first European hub inside the world's largest private hangar at London's Stansted Airport in 2014 and in late 2016 we unveiled a 17,000 square feet renovation of the Clubhouse and Lounge.  The remodel includes a new reception area, private lounges, a bar, dedicated conference facilities, luxurious Majlis lounges and a private security screening area which allows XJet London to now offer Heads of State and VVIPs traveling from the Middle East the highest levels of service, privacy and security available.

A first generation family of food lovers who has a love for good food, which is wholesome, yet fuss-free. Whether it's mature cheddar and onion marmalade on farmhouse white, or a Reuben and coleslaw on rye, we pride ourselves in creating an artisan lunch menu. 

Deli Dubai will come directly to your office floor right when your tummy starts to growl. We understand how important it is to both refuel and save time; therefore our sandwiches will appear at your desk at the same time each day to get you through those last remaining hours; helping you save a few extra minutes in the process.

MISSION

Deli Dubai has one simple mission: to provide you a freshly-made sandwich that will help you plow through the rest of the afternoon! We aren't re-inventing the sandwich experience, we're re-creating it.  

GOAL

Deli Dubai's goal is to provide our clientele with a hand-crafted, home-made sandwich, prepared hours prior to delivery. We take a culinary approach to sandwich making, ensuring the filling not only bursts with flavor, but complements the bread it fills.  

LOCAL

Deli Dubai's menu comprises of healthy lunch options. We want you to feel good about what you eat, so when possible, we use locally sourced, organic ingredients, and put a lot of love and thought into each sandwich we craft.

OUR PROMISE

Each of Deli Dubai's sandwiches is a conversation starter. Whether it's discussing the twist on a classic, or mulling over a unique combination, when you come together to have lunch with your colleagues, we want you to forget about the job, just for that one moment, and simply enjoy the food.

Similar to how the sandwich came to be, the Deli Dubai family came together because each of us recognized that we were just too busy to stop for a long, leisurely lunch. However, unlike the original sandwich, our sandwiches are not quickly assembled; we take our time sourcing produce, and choosing quality ingredients and blending flavours.",2014,https://zenprospect-production.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/pictures/66c194c49de3070001c3dbdc/picture,,,,

-Honesty – we will always be 100% open and honest regarding any fees and charges.   Unlike many of our competitors we won't attempt to hide fees or overcharge on government costs just to increase profit, we believe in complete transparency. We also won't advertise any services for a ‘special' cost which is lower than the amount you have to pay. Saying a service costs ""from"" AED 5,000 when we know it costs AED 7,500 is not only dishonest but it creates the wrong impression. We always provide provide our client's complete set of receipts so that the actual costs and fees are clear transparent.

-Service – a company is measured by the satisfaction of its clients.  At Business Setup Consultants we don't want our clients to be just satisfied, we want them to be delighted!

At HMS Homes clients will get good honest advice from an experienced professional along with regular updates on new properties coming to market and weekly correspondence from our brokers.

Polytrade's core innovations around ERC-6960 and asset tokenization power Polytrade's RWA Marketplace, where individuals and institutions can discover, invest, earn, and exit RWA assets from different asset originators as well as on-chain protocols, from a single application. 

For the first time, the RWA Marketplace will bring together trade finance, equities, T-bills, structured finance, and real estate under one roof and allow these assets to be interoperable and DeFi-ready through ERC-6960.

Apart from the marketplace, Polytrade also runs a trade finance company that invests in high-quality, credit-insured receivables. Unlike RWA lenders and marketplaces, this makes Polytrade one of the only native asset originators in DeFi. In just a year, Polytrade has tokenized over 200 invoices and funded close to $4M in invoices.  

Polytrade is backed by marquee investors Alpha Wave (VC backed by the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), Matrix Partners, and Polygon Ventures. Polytrade's core team brings deep domain experience from J.P. Morgan, Soc Gen, PayU, Securrency, and Fantom and has spent 10+ years in the trade finance industry as entrepreneurs, having advised on more than $500M worth of trade finance deals.
