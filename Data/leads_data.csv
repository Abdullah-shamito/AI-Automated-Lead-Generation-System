The story started with us, two friends, who after having run extensive online research to establish the needs of the digital market, noticed that content was already a common notion and a highly-exercised service, but was rather much generalized and often verbatim. It needed to be more reflective of the culture of the target market, more accurately and better styled to deliver the right message to the right market. I

This left us vast room for improvement in the sector. It was the ideal opportunity for us to finally leave our footprints on the world of content marketing.

So, we decided to set up a small company with one aim in mind: to create better content than what was offered out there, comprehensive and tailored to the different needs and demands of each individual client and field.",2009.0,Small,15.0,129411.76470588235

Deli Dubai,11,food & beverages,Dubai,"sandwiches, soups, salads, desserts",,,1635000.0,"CONCEPT

A first generation family of food lovers who has a love for good food, which is wholesome, yet fuss-free. Whether it's mature cheddar and onion marmalade on farmhouse white, or a Reuben and coleslaw on rye, we pride ourselves in creating an artisan lunch menu. 

Deli Dubai will come directly to your office floor right when your tummy starts to growl. We understand how important it is to both refuel and save time; therefore our sandwiches will appear at your desk at the same time each day to get you through those last remaining hours; helping you save a few extra minutes in the process.

MISSION

Deli Dubai has one simple mission: to provide you a freshly-made sandwich that will help you plow through the rest of the afternoon! We aren't re-inventing the sandwich experience, we're re-creating it.  

GOAL

Deli Dubai's goal is to provide our clientele with a hand-crafted, home-made sandwich, prepared hours prior to delivery. We take a culinary approach to sandwich making, ensuring the filling not only bursts with flavor, but complements the bread it fills.  

LOCAL

Deli Dubai's menu comprises of healthy lunch options. We want you to feel good about what you eat, so when possible, we use locally sourced, organic ingredients, and put a lot of love and thought into each sandwich we craft.

OUR PROMISE

Each of Deli Dubai's sandwiches is a conversation starter. Whether it's discussing the twist on a classic, or mulling over a unique combination, when you come together to have lunch with your colleagues, we want you to forget about the job, just for that one moment, and simply enjoy the food.

Similar to how the sandwich came to be, the Deli Dubai family came together because each of us recognized that we were just too busy to stop for a long, leisurely lunch. However, unlike the original sandwich, our sandwiches are not quickly assembled; we take our time sourcing produce, and choosing quality ingredients and blending flavours.",2014.0,Small,10.0,148636.36363636365

-Honesty – we will always be 100% open and honest regarding any fees and charges.   Unlike many of our competitors we won't attempt to hide fees or overcharge on government costs just to increase profit, we believe in complete transparency. We also won't advertise any services for a ‘special' cost which is lower than the amount you have to pay. Saying a service costs ""from"" AED 5,000 when we know it costs AED 7,500 is not only dishonest but it creates the wrong impression. We always provide provide our client's complete set of receipts so that the actual costs and fees are clear transparent.

-Service – a company is measured by the satisfaction of its clients.  At Business Setup Consultants we don't want our clients to be just satisfied, we want them to be delighted!

Polytrade's core innovations around ERC-6960 and asset tokenization power Polytrade's RWA Marketplace, where individuals and institutions can discover, invest, earn, and exit RWA assets from different asset originators as well as on-chain protocols, from a single application. 

For the first time, the RWA Marketplace will bring together trade finance, equities, T-bills, structured finance, and real estate under one roof and allow these assets to be interoperable and DeFi-ready through ERC-6960.

Apart from the marketplace, Polytrade also runs a trade finance company that invests in high-quality, credit-insured receivables. Unlike RWA lenders and marketplaces, this makes Polytrade one of the only native asset originators in DeFi. In just a year, Polytrade has tokenized over 200 invoices and funded close to $4M in invoices.  

Polytrade is backed by marquee investors Alpha Wave (VC backed by the sovereign wealth fund of Abu Dhabi), Matrix Partners, and Polygon Ventures. Polytrade's core team brings deep domain experience from J.P. Morgan, Soc Gen, PayU, Securrency, and Fantom and has spent 10+ years in the trade finance industry as entrepreneurs, having advised on more than $500M worth of trade finance deals. 

Polytrade has been covered by Techcrunch, CNBC, and the Economic Times. The CEO, Piyush Gupta, has been facilitated by the Times, the Print, and the Indian Government and has delivered multiple keynotes as well as a TEDx lecture.",2021.0,Medium,3.0,54545.454545454544
